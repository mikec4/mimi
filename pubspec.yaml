# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # assets:
  #  - assets/circle.flr2d
  #  - assets/mimi_flare.flr
  #  - assets/pathanimation.flr
  #  - assets/done-checkmark.flr
  #  - assets/red_success.flr
  #  - assets/check_success.flr
  #  - assets/mobyle.flr
  #  - assets/green.flr
  #  - assets/tigopesa.jpg
  #  - assets/TigoPesa-logo.png
  #  - assets/airtel.png
  #  - assets/mpesaIcon.png
  #  - assets/airtel2.png
   #- assets/vodacom-mpesa.png
   #- assets/voda.jpg
   #- assets/airtel-money.jpg


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  fonts:
    # - family: Roboto
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Bold.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
    #     - asset: fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
    
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        #- asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
    #- asset: fonts/OpenSans/OpenSans-Light.ttf
    
    - family: NothingYouCouldDo
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NothingYouCouldDo-Regular.ttf

    - family: NotoSerif
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSerif-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/NotoSerif-Bold.ttf
